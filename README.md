MycoTools is a collection of python functions for computational biology / bioinformatics. 
A central feature of is the `MycoDB` and `dbtools` library, which contains functions necessary for contructing and
interfacing with a database of proteomes, genomes, and gene coordinate files derived from NCBI and / or JGI
